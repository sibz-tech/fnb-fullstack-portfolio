# Variables are used to store data or values in a program.
# Start with a letter or underscore, followed by letters, numbers, or underscores.
# Need to be all lowercase and if it is two words then separate by underscores (snake_case).

#Valid variable names
my_variable = 10
total_count = 0
user = 'John'

#Invalid variable names
2nd_variable = 10 # Starts with a number 
user-name = 'Alice' # Contains a hyphen

#To replace and make valid
second_variable = '10'
user_name = 'Alice'
