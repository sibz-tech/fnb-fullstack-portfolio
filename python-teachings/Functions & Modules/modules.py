# Simply python files with py extension
# Modules are importable files from math_operations.py
# Modules in python keep code organized and reusable and maintainable.

# Example usage of the math_operations module
import math_operations
print(math_operations.add(5, 3))        # Outputs: 8
print(math_operations.subtract(5, 2))   # Outputs: 3 
print(math_operations.multiply(4, 2))   # Outputs: 8
print(math_operations.divide(10, 1))    # Outputs: 5.0
